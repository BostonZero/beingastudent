i spent about 20 minutes of the alphabet and stdio parts, but i spend about 2 hours on powerset figuring out the library and how to use it and 3 hours trying to figure what i was supposed to do for xml but i could not figure out, the question was very confusing and unclear. i eventually figured it out and was able to do it in about 3 more hours
i used various language tutorial sites as i have never used python before
i did not work with any other students, i have no friends.
